# lowres-nx-CHIP
custom compile. LowRes NX for PocketCHIP.

You may need to install the dependencies(I'm not sure because I've already installed so many packages): 

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libopenal-dev libmodplug-dev libvorbis-dev libmpg123-dev libtheora-dev
```

If you want to improve your Pocketchip's performance. Follow this instruction:<https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es/blob/master/COMPILE.md>
